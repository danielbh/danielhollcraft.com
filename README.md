# danielhollcraft.com powered by gatsbyjs and serverless

### Purpose

This the repo for danielhollcraft.com. It could also be used as a template for a freelancer/consultant personal blog. It includes an "about me" as the main page, a portfolio page, services page, blog, and contact form. It uses [gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) for the user interface. For the back-end API it uses [serverless](serverless.com). The deployment of the UI and API are both managed by Serverless and the [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

### Web UI

To create the front-end I used the library [gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) for static content generation. The reason I prefer gatsby.js as a static generation lib is because it uses [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) and I love to React! I use gatsby.js instead of vanilla React because it simplifies development in many ways. Very notably it generates routes through the filesystem. For example if I wanted a top level React component to be the main template for `/blog`, I create a folder in `ui/pages/blog` and then `/blog` will route to that top level component. It's the best part of PHP **WITHOUT** PHP!
 
The website uses [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS pre-processor.

It is deployed using [serverless](https://serverless.com/). While you can use Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, IBM Open Wisk, or Google Cloud for serverless deployments, I used AWS since it is the most mature and best IMHO. Please see [ui/serverless.yml](https://github.com/danielbh/danielhollcraft.com/blob/master/ui/serverless.yml) to see the deployment configuration for the UI. If you are confused about how to create, read, and use `serverless.yml` files, here are a few resources:

- [acloud.guru](https://acloud.guru) where I received most of my education about serverless.
- [serverless docs](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/intro/)

#### To Deploy:

1) Install pre-requisites 
3) You must have a registered domain name that points to AWS name servers.
4) Go to [ui/serverless.yml](https://github.com/danielbh/danielhollcraft.com/blob/master/ui/serverless.yml) and change the following to match the attributes for your project
   - `custom.rootDomain`
   - `custom.devDomains`
   - `custom.prodDomains`
   - `provider.region`
   
   As for everything else in the file I recommend that only advanced users modify it.
5) Deploy UI infrastructure with `ui:deploy:prod`
6) Build the UI with `static:build`
7) Deploy static build to S3 `static:deploy:prod`

### API

The API is deployed with [serverless](http://serverless.com). The API only contains one function that is an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function. The function serves as a submit function for the contact form. It takes the submitted form data and sends it to AWS Lambda which then sends the message via [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) to a specified environmentally configured variable e-mail address. Please see [ui/serverless.yml](https://github.com/danielbh/danielhollcraft.com/blob/master/api/serverless.yml) to see the deployment configuration for the API.
